# RNA-seq Intro Training (Wet-lab Friendly)

This training module introduces basic R and RNA-seq data handling using a small GEO dataset (GSE155432). 
It’s intended for wet-lab scientists learning how to explore and visualize RNA-seq count data.

## 📁 Contents
- `data/`: Public GEO dataset (counts + metadata)
- `scripts/`: R scripts for hands-on walkthrough
- `notebooks/`: RMarkdown version with inline plots and explanations
- `outputs/`: Plots and tables (optional)

## 🧪 Dataset Info
- Source: [GSE155432 (NCBI GEO)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE155432)
- 6 samples: SH-SY5Y cells — differentiated vs undifferentiated
- Format: raw gene counts (CSV), metadata with conditions

## 🖥 Requirements
- R ≥ 4.1
- R packages: `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `readr`, `dplyr`

## 📓 Suggested Session Flow
1. Load data (`read_csv()`)
2. Inspect sample and gene structure
3. Visualize library sizes
4. Identify highly expressed genes
5. Homework: repeat using student's own RNA-seq data

This repo is designed for short hands-on training sessions and can be expanded to include DESeq2, PCA, volcano plots, and more.
