# RNA-seq Intro Training (Wet-lab Friendly)

This short training module introduces basic R and data handling using a simple GEO dataset (GSE60424). 
It’s intended for wet-lab scientists learning how to explore and visualize RNA-seq count data.

## Contents
- `data/`: Public GEO dataset (counts + metadata)
- `scripts/`: R scripts for hands-on walkthrough
- `notebooks/`: RMarkdown version with inline plots and explanations

## Dataset Info
- Source: [GSE60424 (NCBI GEO)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE60424)
- Organism: Homo sapiens
- Samples: RNA was extracted from various human immune cell subsets, including neutrophils, monocytes, B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and natural killer cells, as well as whole blood samples.
- Format: Raw gene counts (CSV), metadata with conditions

## Requirements (very basic!)
- R ≥ 4.1
- R packages: `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `readr`, `dplyr`

## Suggested Session Flow
1. Load data (`read_csv()`)
2. Inspect sample and gene structure
3. Visualize library sizes
4. Identify highly expressed genes
5. Homework: repeat using your own RNA-seq data!

This repo is designed for short hands-on training sessions and can be expanded to include DESeq2, PCA, volcano plots, and more.
